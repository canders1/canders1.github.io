            <div>
                <p>I am in the process of setting up my lab, Empirical and Statistical Explorations of Language (EaSEL). Here are some of the topics EaSEL lab is currently working on:

            <div>

            <p>I am also advising a number of honors thesis projects.</p>

            <h5 class="project">Exploring Name Bias in NLP Models</h5>
            <p>Skylar Kolisko, Class of 2023</p>

            <h5 class="project">Solving and Generating NPR Sunday Puzzles with Large Language Models</h5>

            </div>

            <h2>Research positions</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I don't anticipate taking on any new students in Fall 2023.</p>
                <p>I generally look for students who have taken <b>at least one CS class and at least one Linguistics class</b>.</p>
            </div>

           <!-- <h2>Independent Study</h2>
            <div>
                 <p>Because I have been contacted by so many students interested in natural language processing, I teach an NLP reading group as an independent study. We read papers relevant to my research interests and meet weekly to discuss them.</p>
                 
                 <p>This group is open to any students who have taken CS111 and CS230. However, if you are an advanced Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences student who has not taken CS230, I would also love to have you in the group!</p>

                 <p><b>If you are interested in participating in this research group in Fall 2022,</b> <a href="https://forms.gle/Xhu1DhEgv3QezLHB9">please fill out this form.</a></p>
