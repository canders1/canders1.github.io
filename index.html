                <p>I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College.</p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>My research focuses on the intersection of language, cognition, and computation.</p>

                <p>Within computer science, much of my work focuses on evaluating large language models for natural language and code generation. What are the abilities and limitations of LLMs? Can LLMs help non-expert programmers? I study these questions from a variety of angles, including model development, benchmarking and evaluation, and human-computer interaction studies.</p>

                <p>Within linguistics, I study how context-sensitive meaning is encoded in natural language. I build computational models to understand how conversation participants use knowledge about each other's mental states, and use psycholinguistic methods to understand how people select context-sensitive expressions.</p>
