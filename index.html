                <p>I am a computational linguist and an assistant professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College.</p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>My research focuses on understanding how context-sensitive meaning is encoded in natural language. I study words whose meanings change depending on who is using them and where they are used.</p>

                <p>I build computational models to understand how conversation participants use knowledge about each other's mental states. How do speakers think about their audience when deciding what to say? How do listeners use their knowledge of the speaker when figuring out the meaning of their utterances?</p>

                <p>More recently, I have been focusing on evaluation large language models for natural language and code generation.</p>

                 <p>My dissertation, <b><a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005454?_s=6KVdJSTSZvacd4I_&_k=cqAtx-8HmlYak3QH">Shifting the Perspectival Landscape</a></b>, is now on <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005454?_s=6KVdJSTSZvacd4I_&_k=cqAtx-8HmlYak3QH">LingBuzz</a>.</p>
