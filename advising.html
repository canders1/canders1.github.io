            <h2>Research positions</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I don't anticipate taking on any new students in Spring or Summer 2022.</p>

                <p>I generally look for students who have taken <b>at least one CS class and at least one Linguistics class</b>. However, if you have substantial experience in just one of these fields, feel free to reach out as well.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Independent Study</h2>
            <div>
                 <p>Because I have been contacted by so many students interested in natural language processing, I am going to teach a reading group as an independent study this spring (2022). We will read papers relevant to my research interests, and meet weekly to discuss them.</p>
                 
                 <p>This group is open to any students who have taken CS111 and CS230. However, if you are an advanced Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences student who has not taken CS230, I would also love to have you in the group!</p>

                 <p><b>If you are interested in participating in this research group in Spring 2022,</b> <a href="https://forms.gle/Xhu1DhEgv3QezLHB9">please fill out this form!</a></p>
