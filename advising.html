            <h2>Advising</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I am in the process of setting up my lab, Empirical And Statistical Explorations of Language (EASEL). Several Wellesley students are already working on research projects as part of EASEL:</p>

                <p>Kiara Liu, Class of 2023</p>
                <p>Aizah Rao, Class of 2023</p>
                <p>Alexandra Chin, Class of 2023</p>
                <p>Angel Ding, Class of 2023</p>
                <p>Abigail Kim, Class of 2024</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Research positions</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I don't anticipate taking on any new students in Spring 2022. However, I am looking for students for Summer 2022. If you are a Wellesley student interested in computational approaches to language, please reach out!</p>

                <p>I generally look for students who have taken <b>at least one CS class and at least one Linguistics class</b>. However, if you have substantial experience in just one of these fields, feel free to reach out as well.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Independent Study</h2>
            <div>
                 <p>Because I have been contacted by so many students interested in natural language processing, I am going to teach a reading group as an independent study this spring (2022). We will read papers relevant to my research interests, and meet weekly to discuss them.</p>
                 
                 <p>This group is open to any students who have taken CS111 and CS230. However, if you are an advanced Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences student who has not taken CS230, I would also love to have you in the group!</p>

                 <p><b>If you are interested in participating in this research group in Spring 2022,</b> <a href="https://forms.gle/Xhu1DhEgv3QezLHB9">please fill out this form!</a></p>
