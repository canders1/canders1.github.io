            <h4>Experimental Work</h4>
                <p>I'm currently investigating the semantics of temporal adverbials in English by running online experiments.</p>
                <p>I've been asking people their opinions about different captions for comics using the Ibex Farm platform for psycholinguistics experiments.</p><p>If you're interested in asking people about comics, you can find the Ibex Farm controller I wrote for the task <a href="http://github.com/canders1/ibex_pictures">here</a>.</p>

                <h4>Colonial Valley Zapotec</h4>
                <p>I've worked on topics in the morphosyntax of Colonial Valley Zapotec, most recently negation.</p>
                <p>Dr. Brook Lillehaugen and I presented a description of Colonial Valley Zapotec negation at <a href="http://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#colov">COLOV IV</a> and at the annual meeting of <a href="http://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#ssila">SSILA</a>.</p>
                <p>Our work is in press in the <i>Transactions of the Philological Society</i>.</p>
                
                <h4>The Ticha Project</h4>
                <p>In the summer of 2014, I helped develop a new online home for the <a href="http://ds.haverford.edu/ticha/">Ticha</a> project, a resource for Colonial Zapotec texts.</p>
                <p>Watch me talk about it:</p>
