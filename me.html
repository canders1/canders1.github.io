                <div>
                    <p>I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics at UMass Amherst.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014 with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>My theoretical focus in linguistics is in semantics, the study of meaning in language. I use mathematical tools like logic and type theory to describe how sentences acquire meaning.</p>
                    <p>Much of my work focuses on under-resourced languages. I conduct fieldwork in Oaxaca, Mexico on San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec.</p>
                    <p>I'm also interested in computational and experimental approaches to natural language.</p>
