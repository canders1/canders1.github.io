            <h4>Text-/Web-Scraping for Under-resourced Languages</h4>
            	<p>I'm currently building a corpus for San Lucas Quiavin√≠ Zapotec. I've been scraping Zapotec data from linguistics publications, websites, and Twitter using Python and R.</p>

            	<h4>Phonological Modeling</h4>
            	<p>I'm currently the TA for Gaja Jarosz's graduate-level Cognitive Modeling class. I teach weekly sessions on R and Python, and grade labs on computational techniques for psycholinguistics, like parsing, clustering, and neural nets.</p>
            	<p>As an RA for Gaja Jarosz, I worked on computational learners for phonological hidden structure.</p><p>I worked on improving the efficiency of the implementation of the expectation- and error-driven learners described in Jarosz 2015.</p><p>I also wrote a JavaFX GUI for the learners.</p>
                
                <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
                <p>I spent a summer as an intern for Dr. Nate Foster in the Computer Science department at Cornell University.</p>
                <p>I presented results at <a href="http://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#popl">POPL 2014</a>.</p>
