                <div>
                    <p>I am currently a Fulbright student at University of Victoria and McGill University.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014 with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>My theoretical focus in linguistics is in semantics, the study of meaning in language. I use mathematical tools like logic and type theory to describe how sentences acquire meaning.</p>
                    <p>I also work on language revitalization. Because of my background in computer science, I am interested in how technology can help communities strengthen the situation of their language(s).</p>
                    <p>In the future, I hope to combine my interests by studying the semantics of underdocumented languages.</p>
