                <p>I'm on sabbatical Fall 2024-Spring 2025, and do not plan to work with students while I'm away.</p>
                <p>I generally look for students who have taken <b>at least one CS class and at least one Linguistics class</b>.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Independent Study</h2>
            <div>
                 <p>I typically teach an NLP reading group as an independent study each spring. We read papers relevant to my research interests and meet weekly to discuss them.</p>
                 
                 <p>This group is open to CS students who have taken CS111 and CS230, and advanced Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences students.</p>

                 <p>Due to my research leave, the next planned offering will be Spring 2026.</p>

           <!-- <h2>Independent Study</h2>
            <div>
                 <p>Because I have been contacted by so many students interested in natural language processing, I teach an NLP reading group as an independent study. We read papers relevant to my research interests and meet weekly to discuss them.</p>
                 
                 <p>This group is open to any students who have taken CS111 and CS230. However, if you are an advanced Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences student who has not taken CS230, I would also love to have you in the group!</p>
