                <div>
                    <p>I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics at UMass Amherst.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014 with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>My theoretical focus in linguistics is in semantics, the study of meaning in language. I use mathematical tools like logic and type theory to describe how sentences acquire meaning.</p>
                    <p>I also work on language revitalization. I'm interested in how technology can help communities strengthen the situation of their language(s). I conduct fieldwork in Oaxaca, Mexico on San Lucas Quiavin√≠ Zapotec.</p>
