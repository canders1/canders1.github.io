                <div>
                    <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in Linguistics at UMass Amherst.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014 with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>I study <b>perspective</b> in language: the ways in which people's use of language depends on their point-of-view. This includes context-sensitivity in expressions that describe space and time as well as the ways in which people express their beliefs and opinions.</p>
                    <p>My work focuses on using experimental and computational methods to understand how people express and track perspective across discourses and conversations. I use Bayesian inference techniques to model reasoning about perspective in conversation, and construct production and comprehension experiments to gather empirical evidence.
                    <p>I am also affiliated with the Speech and Language group at BBN Technologies, where I've worked on several topics in automatic speech recognition.</p>
                    <p>Some of my work focuses on under-resourced languages. In particular, I have conducted fieldwork in Oaxaca, Mexico on San Lucas Quiavin√≠ Zapotec.</p>
