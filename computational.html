            <h4 class="project">Bayesian Modeling of Perspective</h4>
                <p>I work on using Bayesian inference to model pragmatics in conversation. In particular, I've developed a perspectival version of the Rational Speech Acts model to capture how conversation participants interpret perspectival items in different utterance contexts. This work was implemented in the WebPPL probabilistic programming language.</p>

            <h4 class="project">Temporal Reference in English</h4>
                <p>I am investigating shifted readings of temporal adverbials like "tomorrow" in English. Ordinarily, these expressions use utterance time as their reference point, but in shifted readings, they anchor instead to a salient reference time in the previous context. I'm running experiments using Lego comic strips to explore how speakers interpret these shifted readings.</p>

            <h4 class="project">Text-/Web-Scraping for Under-resourced Languages</h4>
            	<p>I'm currently building a corpus for San Lucas Quiavin√≠ Zapotec. I've been scraping Zapotec data from linguistics publications, websites, and Twitter using Python and R.</p>

            	<h4 class="project">Phonological Modeling</h4>
            	<p>I was the TA for Gaja Jarosz's graduate-level Cognitive Modeling class in Fall 2017. I taught weekly sessions on Python, and grade labs on computational techniques for psycholinguistics, like parsing, clustering, and neural nets.</p>
            	<p>As an RA for Gaja Jarosz, I worked on computational learners for phonological hidden structure.</p><p>I worked on improving the efficiency of the implementation of the expectation- and error-driven learners described in Jarosz 2015.</p><p>I also wrote a JavaFX GUI for the learners.</p>
                
                <h4 class="project">Programming Languages</h4>
                <p>I spent a summer as an intern for Dr. Nate Foster in the Computer Science department at Cornell University.</p>
                <p>I presented results at <a href="https://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#popl">POPL 2014</a>.</p>
